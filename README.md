**DESCRIPTION:**  
A generative text model is an AI-based system designed to generate human-like text. It is trained on vast amounts of data and uses deep learning techniques, such as **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, and transformer-based architectures like **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**.

These models learn language patterns and contextual relationships, enabling them to produce **coherent and contextually relevant text**. By predicting the next words in a sequence, they mimic **natural language fluency** and can adapt to various topics effectively.

Generative text models are widely used in:
- **Chatbot responses**  
- **Automated content creation**  
- **Machine translation**  
- **Creative writing**  

They play a crucial role in enhancing human-computer interaction by delivering text outputs that are both **intelligent and meaningful**, making them vital tools in modern AI applications.
